This document was created to better explain the changes from ProjectSaturn to ProjectJanus.

For the conversion, a new controller was created for each of the possible nests that a webpage could be under.
Within each controller is a set of actions that correspond to their pages. These actions will serve the pages,
which are actually located under /View/{controller name} in the project directory. These controllers and 
actions can be found below.
