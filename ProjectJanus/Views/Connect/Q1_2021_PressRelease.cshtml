				“This year we doubled down on our dedication to providing a quality learning experience that
				exposed students to important cybersecurity concepts and principles. Like years prior, we
				developed a dynamic virtual environment and themed scenario to supply a holistic cyber defense
				experience.” said Alex Nielson, Cybersecurity Analyst at NIATEC. This is the second year in a
				row that the NICCDC has been held virtually in consideration of the pandemic. This allowed
				NIATEC staff to overcome new challenges and provided new learning opportunities.
			</p>
			<p>As in years past, NIATEC created a unique and creative scenario to engage competitors and enhance
				the learning experience. This year’s theme was “Perry Haughter: Frogwarts School of Bitcraft and
				Cyber-Wizardry” which requisitioned competitors to defend the fictious school network against
				dangerous hacktivist “Voldeworm.” 10 teams from around the mountain west region enrolled in this
				year’s competition. </p>
