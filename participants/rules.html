							</li>
							<li>Blue Team/Competition Team - the institution competitive teams consisting of students
								competing in a NICCDC event.</li>
							<li>Team Captain - a student member of the Blue Team identified as the primary liaison
								between the Blue Team and the White Team.</li>
							<li>Team Co-Captain - a student member of the Blue Team identified as the secondary or

						</ul>

						<ol type="1" start="1">
							<ol type="1" start="1">
								<li><strong>Competitor Eligibility</strong> </li>
								<ol type="a" start="1">
									<li>Competitors in NICCDC events must be full-time students of the institution they
										are representing. </li>
									<ol type="a" start="1">
										<li>Team members must qualify as full-time students as defined by the
											institution they are attending.</li>
										<li>Individual competitors may participate in NICCDC events for a maximum of
											five seasons. A NICCDC season is defined as a typical academic year.
											Participation on a team in any NICCDC event during a given season counts as
											participation for that entire season.</li>
									</ol>
									<li>Competitors may only be a member of one team per NICCDC season, unless special
										approval is granted from NIATEC staff.</li>
									<li>Individuals who have participated in previous NICCDC events in any role other
										than as a competitor must obtain eligibility approval from the NIATEC staff in
										which their team competes prior to being added to the team roster. Once a
										candidate’s eligibility has been approved, they will remain eligible for all
										NICCDC events during the same season.</li>
								</ol>
								<li><strong>Team Composition</strong> </li>
								<ol type="a" start="1">
									<li>Each team must submit a roster of up to the number of competitors specified by
										the NICCDC event to the designated registration system. Rosters must be
										submitted by published deadlines and include a team coach who is a staff or
										faculty member of the institution the team is representing. All competitors on
										the roster must meet all stated eligibility requirements. No changes to the team
										roster will be permitted after the team registration unless special permission
										is granted by NIATEC staff. A competition team is defined as the group of
										individuals competing in a NICCDC event. </li>
									<li>Each competition team may have no more than two (2) graduate students as team
										members unless otherwise indicated by specific NICCDC event registration
										directions.</li>
									<li>If a member of a competition team is unable to attend that NICCDC event, that
										team may substitute another student in their place prior to the start of that
										NICCDC event pending NIATEC staff approval.</li>
									<li>Once a NICCDC event has begun, a team must complete the competition with the
										team that started the competition. Substitutions, additions, or removals of team
										members are prohibited except for extreme circumstances.</li>
									<ol type="a" start="1">
										<li>Team Representatives must petition the NIATEC Cyber Range Director in
											writing for the right to perform a change to the competition team.</li>
										<li>The NIATEC Cyber Range Director must approve any substitutions or additions
											prior to those actions occurring.</li>
									</ol>
									<li>Teams or team members arriving after an event’s official start time, for reasons
										beyond their control, may be allowed to join the competition provided a
										substitution has not already been made. NIATEC event coordinators will review
										the reason for tardiness and make the final determination.</li>
									<li>Each team will designate a Team Captain for the duration of the competition to
										act as the team liaison between the competition staff and the teams before and
										during the competition. In the event of the Team Captain’s absence, teams must
										have an identified team liaison serving as the captain in the competition space
										at all times during competition hours.</li>
									<li>An institution is only allowed to compete one team in any NICCDC event or season
										unless authorized by NIATEC staff or otherwise indicated by specific NICCDC
										event instructions.</li>
									<li>Exhibition teams are not eligible to win any NICCDC event and will not be
										considered for placement rankings in any NICCDC event.</li>
								</ol>
								<li><strong>Team Representatives</strong> </li>
								<ol type="a" start="1">
									<li>Each team must have at least one representative or coach present at every NICCDC
										event. The representative must be a faculty or staff member of the institution
										the team is representing.</li>
									<li>Once a NICCDC event has started, representatives may not coach, assist, or
										advise their team until the completion of that event (including overnight hours
										for multi-day competitions).</li>
									<li>Representatives must not interfere with any other competing team.</li>
									<li>The representative, or any non-team member, must not discuss any aspect of the
										competition event, specifically event injects, configurations, operations, team
										performance or red team functions, with their team during NICCDC competition
										hours and must not attempt to influence their team’s performance in any way.
									</li>
									<li>Team representatives/coaches may not participate on the Red Team, Gold Team,
										Operations Team, Black Team, White Team, or Orange Team at any NICCDC event
										unless requested by NIATEC staff.</li>
								</ol>
								<li><strong>Competition Conduct</strong> </li>
								<ol type="a" start="1">
									<li>Throughout the competition, Operations and White Team members will occasionally
										need access to a team’s system(s) for scoring, troubleshooting, etc. Teams must
										immediately allow Operations and White Team members’ access when requested.</li>
									<li>Teams must not connect any devices or peripherals to the competition network
										unless specifically authorized to do so by Operations or White Team members.
									</li>
									<li>Teams may not modify the hardware configurations of competition systems. Teams
										must not open the case of any server, printer, PC, monitor, kernel-based virtual
										machine, router, switch, firewall, or any other piece of equipment used during
										the competition. All hardware related questions and issues should be referred to
										the White Team.</li>
									<li>Teams may not remove <strong>any </strong>item from the competition area unless
										specifically authorized to do so by Operations or White Team members including
										items brought into the team areas at the start of the competition.</li>
									<li>Team members are forbidden from entering or attempting to enter another team’s
										competition workspace or room during NICCDC events.</li>
									<li>Teams must compete without “outside assistance” from non-team members including
										team representatives from the start of the competition to the end of the
										competition (including overnight hours for multi-day events). All private
										communications (calls, emails, chat, texting, directed emails, forum postings,
										conversations, requests for assistance, etc.) with non-team members including
										team representatives that would help the team gain an unfair advantage are not
										allowed and are grounds for disqualification and/or a penalty assigned to the
										appropriate team.</li>
									<li>Printed reference materials (books, magazines, checklists) are permitted in
										competition areas and teams may bring printed reference materials to the
										competition.</li>
									<li>Team representatives, sponsors, and observers are not competitors and are
										prohibited from directly assisting any competitor through direct advice,
										“suggestions”, or hands-on assistance. Any team sponsor or observers found
										assisting a team will be asked to leave the competition area for the duration of
										the competition and/or a penalty will be assigned to the appropriate team.</li>
									<li>Team members will not initiate any contact with members of the Red Team during
										the hours of live competition. Team members are free to talk to Red Team members
										during official competition events such as breakfasts, dinners, mixers, and
										receptions that occur outside of live competition hours.</li>
									<li>Teams are free to examine their own systems but no offensive activity against
										any system outside the team's assigned network(s), including those of other
										NICCDC teams, will be tolerated. Any team performing offensive activity against
										any system outside the team's assigned network(s) will be immediately
										disqualified from the competition. If there are any questions or concerns during
										the competition about whether or not specific actions can be considered
										offensive in nature contact the Operations Team before performing those actions.
									</li>
									<li>Teams are allowed to use active response mechanisms such as TCP resets when
										responding to suspicious/malicious activity. Any active mechanisms that
										interfere with the functionality of the scoring engine or manual scoring checks
										are exclusively the responsibility of the teams. Any firewall rule, IDS, IPS, or
										defensive action that interferes with the functionality of the scoring engine or
										manual scoring checks are exclusively the responsibility of the teams.</li>
									<li>All team members will wear badges identifying team affiliation at all times
										during competition hours.</li>
									<li>Only Operations Team/White Team members will be allowed in competition areas
										outside of competition hours.</li>
								</ol>
								<li><strong>Internet Usage </strong></li>
								<ol type="a" start="1">
									<li>Internet resources such as FAQs, how-to's, existing forums and responses, and
										company websites, are completely valid for competition use provided there is no
										fee required to access those resources and access to those resources has not
										been granted based on a previous membership, purchase, or fee. Only resources
										that could reasonably be available to all teams are permitted. For example,
										accessing Cisco resources through a CCO account would not be permitted but
										searching a public Cisco support forum would be permitted. Public sites such as
										Security Focus or Packetstorm are acceptable. Only public resources that every
										team could access if they chose to are permitted.</li>
									<li>Teams may not use any external, private electronic staging area or FTP site for
										patches, software, etc. during the competition. Teams are not allowed to access
										private Internet-accessible libraries, FTP sites, web sites, network storage,
										email accounts, or shared drives during the competition. All Internet resources
										used during the competition must be freely available to all other teams. The use
										of external collaboration and storage environments such as Google Docs/Drive is
										prohibited unless the environment was provided by and is administered by
										competition officials. Accessing private staging areas or email accounts is
										grounds for disqualification and/or a penalty assigned to the respective team.
									</li>
									<li>No peer to peer or distributed file sharing clients or servers are permitted on
										competition networks unless specifically authorized by the competition
										officials.</li>
									<li>Internet activity, where allowed, will be monitored and any team member caught
										viewing inappropriate or unauthorized content will be subject to
										disqualification and/or a penalty assigned to the appropriate team. This
										includes direct contact with outside sources through AIM/chat/email or any other
										public or non-public services including sites such as Facebook. For the purposes
										of this competition inappropriate content includes pornography or explicit
										materials, pirated media files, sites containing key generators and pirated
										software, etc. If there are any questions or concerns during the competition
										about whether or not specific materials are unauthorized contact the White Team
										immediately.</li>
									<li>All network activity that takes place on the competition network may be logged
										and subject to release. Competition officials are not responsible for the
										security of any information, including login credentials, which competitors
										place on the competition network.</li>
									<li>Scripts, executables, tools, and programs written by active team members may be
										used in NICCDC events provided: </li>
									<ol type="a" start="1">
										<li>The scripts, executables, tools, and programs have been published as a
											publicly available resource on a public and non-university affiliated site
											such as GitHub or SourceForge for at least 6 months prior to their use in
											any NICCDC event. </li>
										<li>Teams must send the public links and descriptions of the team-written
											scripts, executables, tools, and programs to the appropriate NIATEC Cyber
											Range Director at least 30 days prior to their use in any NICCDC event.
											Development must be “frozen” at time of submission with no modifications or
											updates until after the team competes in their last NICCDC event of that
											season.</li>
										<li>Teams must consent to the distribution of the submitted links and
											descriptions to all other teams competing in the same NICCDC event where the
											team-written scripts, executables, tools, and programs will be used.</li>
										<li>Team written tools, scripts, or executables that use resources outside of
											the competition environment other than simple DNS lookups are prohibited
											(i.e. tools that use cloud services or cloud processing outside of the
											competition environment are prohibited). </li>
										<li>Team written tools, scripts, or executables that transmit data outside of
											the competition environment (such as log data) must be declared to
											competition officials at least 30 days prior to their use in any NICCDC
											event. Teams must obtain written authorization from competition officials
											prior to using these tools in any NICCDC event. Approval or rejection of
											these tools is at the sole discretion of competition officials and NIATEC
											Staff.</li>
									</ol>
								</ol>
								<li><strong>Permitted Materials</strong> </li>
								<ol type="a" start="1">
									<li>No memory sticks, flash drives, removable drives, CDROMs, electronic media, or
										other similar electronic devices are allowed in the room during the competition
										unless specifically authorized by the Operations or White Team in advance. Any
										violation of these rules will result in disqualification of the team member
										and/or a penalty assigned to the appropriate team.</li>
									<li>Teams may not bring any type of computer, laptop, tablet, PDA, cell phone, smart
										phone, or wireless device into the competition area unless specifically
										authorized by the Operations Staff or White Team in advance. Any violation of
										these rules will result in disqualification of the team member and/or a penalty
										assigned to the appropriate team. </li>
									<li>Printed reference materials (books, magazines, checklists) are permitted in
										competition areas and teams may bring printed reference materials to the
										competition as specified by the competition officials.</li>
								</ol>
								<li><strong>Professional Conduct</strong> </li>
								<ol type="a" start="1">
									<li>All participants, including competitors, coaches, White Team, Red Team, Ops
										Team, and Gold Team members, are expected to behave professionally at all times
										during all NICCDC events including preparation meetings, receptions, mixers,
										banquets, competitions and so on.</li>
									<li>In addition to published NICCDC rules, Host Site policies and rules apply
										throughout the competition and must be respected by all NICCDC participants.
									</li>
									<li>All NICCDC events are alcohol free events. No drinking is permitted at any time
										during competition hours. </li>
									<li>Activities such as swearing, consumption of alcohol or illegal drugs,
										disrespectful or unruly behavior, sexual harassment, improper physical contact,
										becoming argumentative, willful violence, or willful physical damage have no
										place at the competition and will not be tolerated. </li>
									<li>Violations of the rules can be deemed unprofessional conduct if determined to be
										intentional or malicious by competition officials.</li>
									<li>Competitors behaving in an unprofessional manner may receive a warning from the
										White Team, Gold Team, or Operations Team for their first offense. For egregious
										actions or for subsequent violations following a warning, competitors may have a
										penalty assessed against their team, be disqualified, and/or expelled from the
										competition site. Competitors expelled for unprofessional conduct will be banned
										from future NICCDC competitions.</li>
									<li>Individual(s), other than competitors, behaving in an unprofessional manner may
										be warned against such behavior by the White Team or asked to leave the
										competition entirely by the Competition Director, the Operations Team, or Gold
										Team.</li>
								</ol>
								<li><strong>Questions, Disputes, and Disclosures</strong> </li>
								<ol type="a" start="1">
									<li>PRIOR TO THE COMPETITION: Team captains are encouraged to work with the NIATEC
										Cyber Range Director and their staff to resolve any questions regarding the
										rules of the competition or scoring methods before the competition begins. </li>
									<li>DURING THE COMPETITION: Protests by any team must be presented in writing by the
										Team Captain to the White Team as soon as possible. The competition officials
										will be the final arbitrators for any protests or questions arising before,
										during, or after the competition. Rulings by the competition officials are
										final.</li>
									<li>In the event of an individual disqualification, that team member must leave the
										competition area immediately upon notification of disqualification and must not
										re-enter the competition area at any time. Disqualified individuals are also
										ineligible for individual or team awards.</li>
									<li>In the event of a team disqualification, the entire team must leave the
										competition area immediately upon notice of disqualification and is ineligible
										for any individual or team award.</li>
									<li>All competition materials including injects, scoring sheets, and team-generated
										reports and documents must remain in the competition area. Only materials
										brought into the competition area by the student teams may be removed after the
										competition concludes.</li>
								</ol>
								<li><strong>Scoring</strong> </li>
								<ol type="a" start="1">
									<li>Scoring will be based on keeping required services up, controlling/preventing
										un-authorized access, and completing business tasks that will be provided
										throughout the competition. Teams accumulate points by successfully completing
										injects and maintaining services. Teams lose points by violating service level
										agreements, usage of recovery services, and successful penetrations by the Red
										Team.</li>
									<li>Scores will be maintained by the competition officials and may be shared at the
										end of the competition. There will be no running totals provided during the
										competition unless otherwise specified for individual NICCDC events. Team
										rankings may be provided at the beginning of each competition day.</li>
									<li>Any team action that interrupts the scoring system is exclusively the
										responsibility of that team and will result in a lower score. Any team member
										that modifies a competition system or system component, with or without intent,
										in order to mislead the scoring engine into assessing a system or service as
										operational, when in fact it is not, may be disqualified and/or the team
										assessed penalties. Should any question arise about scoring, the scoring engine,
										or how scoring functions, the Team Captain should immediately contact the
										competition officials to address the issue.</li>
									<li>Teams are strongly encouraged to provide incident reports for each Red Team
										incident they detect. Incident reports can be completed as needed throughout the
										competition and presented to the White Team for collection. Incident reports
										must contain a description of what occurred (including source and destination IP
										addresses, timelines of activity, passwords cracked, access obtained, damage
										done, etc), a discussion of what was affected, and a remediation plan. A
										thorough incident report that correctly identifies and addresses a successful
										Red Team attack may reduce the Red Team penalty for that event – no partial
										points will be given for incomplete or vague incident reports.</li>
								</ol>
								<li><strong>Remote / Team Site Judging Compliance </strong></li>

								<p>With the advent of viable remote access technologies and virtualization, teams will
									have the ability to participate in NICCDC events from their respective institutions.
									This section addresses policy for proper engagement in NICCDC events for remote
									teams.</p>
								<ol type="a" start="1">
									<li>One or more Remote Site Judge(s) must be assigned to the team site. At least
										one Remote Site Judge must be present at the remote site for the duration of the
										event in order to facilitate the execution of the NICCDC. The qualifications of
										Remote Site Judge are the same as Event Judge. Subject to the specifications of
										the remote competition, the responsibilities of the Remote Site Judge may
										include the following:</li>
									<ol>
										<li>Be present with the participating team to assure compliance with all event
											rules</li>
										<li>Provide direction and clarification to the team as to rules and requirements
										</li>
										<li>Establish communication with all Event Judges and provide status when
											requested</li>
										<li>Provide technical assistance to remote teams regarding use of the remote
											system</li>
										<li>Review all equipment to be used during the remote competition for compliance
											with all event rules</li>
										<li>Assure that the Team Captain has communicated to the Event Judges approval
											of initial system integrity and remote system functionality</li>
										<li>Assist Event Judges in the resolution of grievances and disciplinary action,
											including possible disqualification, where needed</li>
										<li>Report excessive misconduct to local security or police</li>
										<li>Assess completion of various injects based on timeliness and quality when
											requested by Event Judges</li>
										<li>Act as a liaison to site personnel responsible for core networking and
											internet connectivity</li>
										<li>Provide direct technical assistance to teams when requested by Event Judges
										</li>
										<li>Provide feedback to students subsequent to the completion of the NICCDC
											event</li>
									</ol>

									<li>A recommendation for Remote Site Judge(s) is expected to be given from a
										Team representative of the participating institution to the NICCDC Event
										Manager. Remote Site Judge(s) must not be currently employed, a student of,
										or otherwise affiliated with the participating institution, other than
										membership on an advisory board. NICCDC Event Managers should also be
										apprised of a contact from the participating institution responsible for
										core networking and internet connectivity that will be available during the
										NICCDC event. Remote teams are required to compete from a location with
										controlled access, i.e., a separate room or a portion of a room that is
										dedicated for use during the NICCDC event. Workstations and internet access
										must comply with published requirements.</li>
