### Goal of Project
This project stems from ProjectSaturn and its goal is to convert the NICCDC Website to Microsoft ASP.Net Core MVC.

### Cookie Storage
This project uses a cookie to store a list of models for all of the current models. These cookies need to be as protected as
possible due to them containing ppi. Please keep this in mind when administering changes to code that affects these cookies.

### Project Code
The current focus of this project is to convert the exsisting html pages to cshtml then connect them to the MVC controllers.
The code that comes from ProjectSaturn will also just need finalizing before deployment.

### Side Notes:
Currently the naming scheme is consistant, but could be better on both the front and back ends. I attempted to keep the scheme consistant when naming stored procedures,
controllers, etc.

### Future TODO List
Use ctrl + shift + f to find all instances of //TODO in order to find all of the open Todos.
