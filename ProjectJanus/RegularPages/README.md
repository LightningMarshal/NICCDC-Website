# NICCDC-Website
This is a workspace for the NIATEC NICCDC Website. Right now we have our production schedule set to have this go live at the end of July 2022. We still have a lot of tasks to complete, content to populate, and a few bugs to fix.

Not sure where to start? Go ahead and take a look at the open issues tab and see if there is something you can help out with. Assign yourself the issue and document your work!

#### Major, Minor, and Patch (Example: 1.0.0)
- Major number: The major number indicates the current version of the package’s public interface. This should be incremented every time you make a change that would require existing users of your package to update their own work.
- Minor number: The minor number describes the current functional release of your software. This is incremented whenever you add a new feature but do not otherwise alter your package’s interface. It communicates to users that a significant change has been made but the package remains fully backwards compatible with the previous minor number.
- Patch number: The patch number gets incremented every time you make a minor change that neither impacts the public interface or overall functionality of your package. This is most commonly used for bug fixes. Consumers should always be able to update to the latest patch release without hesitation.
