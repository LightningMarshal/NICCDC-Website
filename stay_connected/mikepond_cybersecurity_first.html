						<h2>Cybersecurity First</h2>
						<p>By Mike Pond</p>
					</header>
					<p>
						Still in recent memory is a year plagued with natural disasters, infectious diseases, and
						cyberattacks. This past May, an American oil pipeline was shutdown to contain a ransomware
						attack. For the uninitiated, ransomware is an increasingly common cyberattack that locks out the
						owner of a computer system typically until a ransom is paid to the attacker. The attack on
						Colonial Pipeline caused panic buying and fuel shortages. However, this isn’t the first time
						that a cyberattack has had a real-world impact. Hospitals and the healthcare industry are
						reeling from a significant rise in the number of targeted cyberattacks that have left some
						facilities unable to render care.
					</p>
					<p>
						Although the threat of cyberattack to both public and private organizations is growing, it’s
						nothing new. Along with the formation of the newly minted Space Force, former President Donald
						Trump ushered in the creation of the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Agency, or CISA in 2018.
						Many lauded the creation of the new agency housed under the Department of Homeland Security as a
						bet on the importance of nationally secure cyber operations in the years ahead. News last
						December of suspected state-sponsored Russian hackers’ intrusion into government and private
						information systems illustrate that the creation of CISA and good cybersecurity practices are
						not only necessary, they are imperative.
					</p>
					<p>What’s more is that we are currently in the midst of a several years long cybersecurity talent
						drought with no immediate end in sight. There are over 500,000 open cybersecurity positions
						nationwide according to Cyber Seek – a job tracking database from the U.S. Commerce Department.
						So, what gives? If across the nation we are getting hammered by cybersecurity attacks, why
						aren’t people flocking to fill those jobs whose starting pay ranges anywhere from $60,000 to
						over $100,000?</p>
					<p>The data suggests that people are flocking to fill the positions and in droves, but it’s still
						not enough to meet the demand. However, it’s a little more complicated than just filling the
						positions. Data gathered by Cyber Seek indicates filling an IT related roles takes 21% longer on
						average than filling non-IT related roles. One major roadblock that analysts are seeing is those
						that are tasked with making hiring decisions don’t understand the actual skillset that they are
						looking for. They don’t speak the language of cybersecurity and end up missing key details on
						resumes. </p>
					<p>Another significant issue is lingering cultural attitudes surrounding the cybersecurity field. It
						is constantly changing and what might have been seen as a best practice last year might be
						outdated this year and leave information or organizations vulnerable. It takes time, resources,
						and ultimately money to hold the proverbial fort down. This often pits management against their
						information technology department colleagues. Too often, cybersecurity is viewed as a hindrance
						to operations or a thorn in the side of those attempting to fulfill the main goals of an
						organization. When the fact is, cybersecurity should be one of the top priorities and seen as an
						enabler of the main objectives of an organization. For example, Colonial Pipeline when affected
						with ransomware, could not distribute the necessary oil and fuel because operations were halted.
						We need many more than the current 500,000 open cybersecurity positions to fill the actual
						needs.</p>

							<h3>What's the Bottom-Line for the Average American?</h3>
						</header>
						<p>
						<ul>
							• If you are a business owner, put cybersecurity first. When considering business
							operations, build in security principles from the very start. It is very difficult to
							implement security after a security incident has occurred. Consider your risk tolerance, and
							make adjustments as necessary. In other words, most businesses don’t need the protections of
							Fort Knox, but they certainly need more than they currently have.
						</ul>
						<ul>• Not a business owner and looking for a new career? There literally could not be a better
							time to transition into cybersecurity or IT. Many open positions do not require a college
							degree. There are many certifications that open the door entry level job opportunities. The
							barrier to entry has never been lower with many free resources accessible via the internet.
							Local institutions such as Idaho State University offer courses and opportunities such as
							the NIATEC program (https://sfs.niatec.iri.isu.edu/)</ul>
						<ul>• Make cybersecurity a priority in your own life. Using different passwords for different
							accounts, making sure that your passwords are long, and enabling two-factor authentication
							can go a long way in preventing yourself from personally becoming a victim. Having a
							vigilant mindset is important. Spam is getting more advanced. It’s becoming harder to detect
							misinformation. Being initially skeptical of unexpected communications can help you protect
							yourself. </ul>
