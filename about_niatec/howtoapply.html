						<h2>The National Information Assurance Training and Education Center Program</h2>
						<p>Come Join the Best Scholarship for Service Program in the Nation</p>
					</header>
					<p>
						The National Science Foundation and the Department of Homeland Security sponsor the Scholarship
						for Service (SFS) program administered
						through the National Information Assurance Training and Education Center (NIATEC). Competitively
						selected NIATEC students are offered
						scholarships in exchange for helping to design safeguards for cyber security threats in
						government. Upon graduation, students will often serve
						at federal agencies such as the FBI. As part of their scholarship, students receive numerous
						benefits including a $32,000 yearly stipend, paid tuition and fees and necessary
						allowances for professional development and textbooks.
					</p>
					<p>
						“[Students have many] experiential learning opportunities including handling classified material
						for cyber war simulations. We have even
						offered international simulations to support components of Hawaii, Washington and California
						National Guards. Since the program’s inception,
						we have had 100 percent job placement for our graduates.”

						-Dr. Corey Schou, NIATEC Director

							<h3>Scholarship Benefits</h3>
						</header>
						<p>
							The program includes many benefits:
						</p>
						<ul>
							<li>A graduate student will be paid a stipend of $34,000 per year.</li>
							<li>Each student will be assigned to exploratory research projects investigating issues
								related to large externally funded projects. Additional academic year funding may be
								available to most students involved in these projects.</li>
							<li>All applicable tuition and fees, including any out-of-state and graduate student fees,
								will be paid on behalf of the scholarship recipients. This support is provided in
								addition to the stipend and includes:</li>
							<ul>
								<li>Paid graduate tuition</li>
								<li>Health insurance coverage up to $2,000 annually</li>
								<li>Professional development allowance</li>
								<li>Book allowance</li>
								<li>Access to extensive alumni network</li>
							</ul>

						</ul>
						<p>
							The Information Assurance Program (IAP), (colloquially known as the NIATEC Program) at Idaho
							State University is the home for the
							Scholarship For Service (CyberCorps).
						</p>
						<p>
							Information Assurance is important for defending critical infrastructure worldwide. The IAP
							defines new directions and leads students
							to the beginning of a life-long learning process that helps them continually define their
							future. The IAP program emphasizes Information
							Systems and security skills in all organizations and many technical disciplines. Graduates
							from the IAP are information systems
							professionals with a broad spectrum of both technical and managerial skills. They use these
							skills to integrate information from
							seemingly disparate disciplines such as national security affairs, information systems,
							computer science, business, and operations
							analysis; into a coherent plan to support enterprise operations.
						</p>
						<p>
							All IAP students are aware of the full spectrum of threats and vulnerabilities in
							information systems. They are skilled at protecting data,
							information, and the means of processing them. They recognize that Information Assurance is
							more than technical solutions. Information Assurance
							is a defense in depth that balances Technology, Policy and Practice, Awareness, and Training
							and Education. The students apply this knowledge
							through industry best practices and the Federal Information Security Management Act (FISMA).
						</p>
						<p>
							All students in the Idaho State University program are aware of principles and practices in
							Information Assurance. Information Systems majors are
							provided with introductory skills and abilities to design and execute Information Assurance
							procedures and practices. A student choosing to emphasize
							Information Assurance or to seek Center for National Security Systems (CNSS) certifications,
							develop a full repertoire of skills ranging from Systems
							Administration to Senior Systems Management and Certification.
						</p>
						Each year, the program develops a group of highly motivated, educated Information Systems
						professionals who are knowledgeable in the principles of Information
						Assurance. The program goal is to reduce vulnerability in our National Information
						Infrastructure by promoting higher education in Information Assurance and
						producing a growing number of professionals with Information Assurance expertise in many
						disciplines.
						</p>
						The overall quality of our program is demonstrated through our selection as a National Center of
						Academic Excellence in Computer Security Education and as a National
						Science Foundation Scholarship for Service school. Our Scholarship for Service program graduates
						are now serving in management roles for all branches of the federal
						government. Several are serving on many different information assurance industry advisory and
						certification boards.
