						<h2>NIATEC Invitational Collegiate Cyber Defense Competition</h2>
					</header>
				</article>
				<p>Since 2001, the NIATEC Invitational Collegiate Cyber Defense Competition (NICCDC) has
					provided
					an unparalleled source of academic learning via in-depth scenario immersion. Our
					competition experience is designed to stimulate mission-oriented decision making
					through scenarios that score decision making over technical abilities. Decisions made
					throughout the competition should drive the mission and objectives of the fictional
					organizations led by each competitive team. The objective of the competition
					is to create teaching opportunities through challenging yet rewarding business
					objectives, also known as injects, delegated to participants throughout the
					competition. These injects will focus on ensuring that participants are able to
					effectively integrate the Maconachy-Schou-Ragsdale (MSR) model into their mission-oriented
					decision making.</p>
				<p>In addition to being designed around learning objectives, the competition is designed
					to be enjoyable for all who participate. It is our goal to ensure that every
					participant leaves the competition feeling a strong sense of accomplishment and an
					exposure to foundational physical and cybersecurity principles. Participants will be
					immersed in realistic environments designed to create excitement and opportunities
					for critical thinking. Teams will be directly challenged by adversaries (Red Team)
					whose sole purpose is to cause chaos and minimize functionality of insecure
					environments. Participants will need to come prepared to safeguard assigned assets
					and minimize the risks directly impacting their team’s ability to function as a
					cohesive unit. </p>
				<p>Teams will be accepted on a first come first serve basis, therefore teams are
					encouraged to register as soon as possible in order to solidify the team’s spot in
					the competition. Any teams turned away due to space restrictions, will receive a
					full refund for paid registration fees. Please visit our <a
						asp-controller="NICCDC" asp-action="Participants">Participants Page</a> for more
					information on rules and registration. For any additional questions, comments, or concerns
					please do not hesitate to contact us.</p>
