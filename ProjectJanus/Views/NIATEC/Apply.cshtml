				<h2>The National Information Assurance Training and Education Center Program</h2>
				<p>Come Join the Best Scholarship for Service Program in the Nation</p>
			</header>
			<p>
				The National Science Foundation and the Department of Homeland Security sponsor the Scholarship
				for Service (SFS) program administered
				through the National Information Assurance Training and Education Center (NIATEC). Competitively
				selected NIATEC students are offered
				scholarships in exchange for helping to design safeguards for cyber security threats in
				government. Upon graduation, students will often serve
				at federal agencies such as the FBI. As part of their scholarship, students receive numerous
				benefits including a $32,000 yearly stipend, paid tuition and fees and necessary
				allowances for professional development and textbooks.
			</p>
			<p>
				“[Students have many] experiential learning opportunities including handling classified material
				for cyber war simulations. We have even
				offered international simulations to support components of Hawaii, Washington and California
				National Guards. Since the program’s inception,
				we have had 100 percent job placement for our graduates.”

				-Dr. Corey Schou, NIATEC Director

					The Information Assurance Program (IAP), (colloquially known as the NIATEC Program) at Idaho
					State University is the home for the
					Scholarship For Service (CyberCorps).
				</p>
				<p>
					Information Assurance is important for defending critical infrastructure worldwide. The IAP
					defines new directions and leads students
					to the beginning of a life-long learning process that helps them continually define their
					future. The IAP program emphasizes Information
					Systems and security skills in all organizations and many technical disciplines. Graduates
					from the IAP are information systems
					professionals with a broad spectrum of both technical and managerial skills. They use these
					skills to integrate information from
					seemingly disparate disciplines such as national security affairs, information systems,
					computer science, business, and operations
					analysis; into a coherent plan to support enterprise operations.
				</p>
				<p>
					All IAP students are aware of the full spectrum of threats and vulnerabilities in
					information systems. They are skilled at protecting data,
					information, and the means of processing them. They recognize that Information Assurance is
					more than technical solutions. Information Assurance
					is a defense in depth that balances Technology, Policy and Practice, Awareness, and Training
					and Education. The students apply this knowledge
					through industry best practices and the Federal Information Security Management Act (FISMA).
				</p>
				<p>
					All students in the Idaho State University program are aware of principles and practices in
					Information Assurance. Information Systems majors are
					provided with introductory skills and abilities to design and execute Information Assurance
					procedures and practices. A student choosing to emphasize
					Information Assurance or to seek Center for National Security Systems (CNSS) certifications,
					develop a full repertoire of skills ranging from Systems
					Administration to Senior Systems Management and Certification.
				</p>
				<p>
					Each year, the program develops a group of highly motivated, educated Information Systems
					professionals who are knowledgeable in the principles of Information
					Assurance. The program goal is to reduce vulnerability in our National Information
					Infrastructure by promoting higher education in Information Assurance and
					producing a growing number of professionals with Information Assurance expertise in many
					disciplines.	
				</p>
				<p>
					The overall quality of our program is demonstrated through our selection as a National Center of
					Academic Excellence in Computer Security Education and as a National
					Science Foundation Scholarship for Service school. Our Scholarship for Service program graduates
					are now serving in management roles for all branches of the federal
					government. Several are serving on many different information assurance industry advisory and
					certification boards.
